# grafalgo
Grafalgo is a library of graph algorithms and associated data structures.
It was originally created to support a graduate course in advanced data structures
and algorithms at Washington University. Consequently, it includes a variety of
different algorithms for various problems. The code is highly efficient, but
includes only minimal error checking (and mostly in the form of assertion macros
that can be disabled). If you choose to use it in a production setting, you are advised
to study the code carefully to make sure it is suitable for your purpose.
