This directory contains algorithms for the "edge-group coloring problem"

In this problem, the edges are divided into groups.
We let g_(e) denote the group at that contains edge e.

We focus on the version of the problem in which graph is bipartite
and all non-trivial groups form "stars" that are centered at an "input"

Data structures for edge-group coloring
- undirected graph
- list pair defining inputs and outputs
- array assigning a group number to each edge
- a circular list set of edge numbers that partitions the
  edge numbers by group
- a circular list set of group numbers that partitions the
  group numbers among inputs
- a firstEdge array that gives a first edge in a specified group
- a firstGroupAt array that gives a first edge group at an input
- arrays delta(u) and d(u), also Delta_out and D_in

Basic approx

repeat until all edges are colored

select a group at each input and let k be the max output degree
of the subgraph defined by these groups; color the groups with k new colors
- when selecting groups, seek to minimize max degree at outputs
  and choose fanout close to (# of unmatched vertices)/(# of groups to select)
