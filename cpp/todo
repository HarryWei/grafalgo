Complete documentation of graph algorithms

Replace item terminology with index

Start shifting to C++11.

Rework Utility class and stdinc.
- is there a better way to do simple parsing?
- get a token from input, where a token has some recognizable type
  char, int, float, word, name, string and possibly specific value
  if what comes next is not what I am looking for, put it back;
  skip over whitespace, optionally not on end-of-line
- timing stuff based on C++?

Use namespaces for grafalgo

Put inlines inside class declaration

Use templates for data structures that use keys.
What about maps? Should I try to do handle strings as keys?

Add unit tests for all data structures; replace old dvr programs

Add unit tests for graph algorithms; when multiple
algorithms for same problem, can do random generation
and check values returned as one simple approach

Augment the Java stuff. Maybe do some animations?
